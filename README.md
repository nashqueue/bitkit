# üÖ±Ô∏èitkit

## The stack

Bitkit is built with [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/), [Rollkit](https://rollkit.dev/), & [Ethermint](https://github.com/celestiaorg/ethermint).

Bitkit is built on Bitcoin to provide [data availability](https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability) & [consensus](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms), leveraging Ethermint with Rollkit as the [execution environment](https://celestia.org/glossary/execution-environment).

This allows users to securely create and share messages on the sovereign rollup secured by Bitcoin.
